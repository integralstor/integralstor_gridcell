##### Primary configuration settings #####

# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Salt Minion.
# With the exception of the location of the Salt Master Server, values that are
# commented out but have an empty line after the comment are defaults that need
# not be set in the config. If there is no blank line after the comment, the
# value is presented as an example and is not the default.

# Per default the minion will automatically include all config files
# from minion.d/*.conf (minion.d is a directory in the same directory
# as the main minion config file).
#default_include: minion.d/*.conf

# Set the location of the salt master server. If the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.
